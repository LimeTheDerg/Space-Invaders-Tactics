# Space-Invaders-Tactics
 A simple CLI strategy game made with Java. Have fun!
 To play the game, download either the redist file or the release zip and run the "rungame.bat" batch script (No mac support cause I don't really care)
 This is heavily inspired from the 1970s MSDOS game "Star Trek"
 This project was made purely for fun.
 I hope you enjoy the game!
